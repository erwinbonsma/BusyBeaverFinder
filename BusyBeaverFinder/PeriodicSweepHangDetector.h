 *
 * It should identify all sweep hangs for which the following holds:
 * - The hang results in an endless meta-run loop (i.e. the hang is regular)
 *   It therefore does not detect loops with a FIXED_APERIODIC_APPENDIX sweep end-type, which
 *   execute a kind of binary count
 * - A sweep in a given direction always executes the same loop (under rotation-equivalence)
 *   Note: The rotation-equivalence allowance means that the entry instruction for this loop may
 *   differ
 *   - The loop may switch mid-sweep to another one. In that case, the outgoing loop should always
 *     be the same (under rotation-equivalence), and the incoming loop should always be the same.
